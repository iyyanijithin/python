High level steps for preprocessing is as follows:

1) Load the data using pandas.
2) Split the data as dependent and feature variables.
3) If there are some empty data elements then we can use imputer and other library in scklearn in order to populate them.
4) We need to convert non numberic columns to numeric column, this can be done using OneHotEncoder or LabelEncoder
5) Feature scaling (This is the process where we bring all the feature variables to the same scale.
6) Split the data set into x train and y train
